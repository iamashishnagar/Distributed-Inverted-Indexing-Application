# Distributed-Inverted-Indexing-Application
A scalable inverted indexing program using Hazelcast’s distributed map, streamlining word occurrence counting in files.

This project implements two versions of the inverted indexing program using Hazelcast’s distributed map that maintains a database of <key, value> items, each with key = a file name and value = its text data. One version is InvertedIndexingLocal.java, which retrieves each file from the database, counts the occurrences of a given word, and prints out the file name and the number of occurrences. The other version is InvertedIndexingRemote.java, which dispatches InvertedIndexingEach.class to each remote cluster node where it counts the occurrences of a given word in only files local to that remote node. The purpose of this assignment is to understand Hazelcast’s mechanism of remote execution and to measure its execution performance.

**DBCreator.java** Receives a directory of text files; joins a Hazelcast environment; creates a IMap<String, String> named “files” where key = a file name and value = entire file contents; reads each text file from the directory; add this file name and its contents to the IMap as a new key-value tuple.

**RemoteKeyViewer.java** Joins a Hazelcasst environment; retrieves a set of cluster members; and dispatches a RemoteKeySearchCallable program to each member. Upon a response and completion of each cluster member’s execution of RemoteKeySearchCallable, it prints out the execution output in onResponse( ) and onComplete( ) respectively. The output is the number of files and their names local to each cluster member.

**RemoteKeySearchCallable.java** Invokes the call( ) method at each cluster member; accesses the shared IMap named “files”; retrieves the keys, (i.e., file names) of only tuples <file name, contents> local to that cluster member; and returns the number of local files and their names.

**InvertedIndexingLocal.java** Receives an inverted-indexing keyword in args[0]; joins a Hazelcast environment; starts a timer for performance measurement; retrieves the shared IMap named “files”; retrieves an iterator of all key-value tuples; counts the occurrence of the keyword of each file; stops the timer; and prints out “File[name] has #occurences”.

**InvertedIndexingRemote.java** Receives an inverted-indexing keyword in args[0]; joins a Hazelcasst environment; starts a timer for performance measurement; retrieves a set of cluster members; and dispatches an InvertedIndexingEach program to each member. Upon completion of all cluster members’ execution of InvertedIndexingEach, it moves each cluster member’s <filename, occurrences> tuples to the local hash; stops the timer; and prints out this local hash contents as “File[name] has #occurences”.

**InvertedIndexingEach.java** Invokes the call( ) method at each cluster member; accesses the shared IMap named “files”; retrieves the keys, (i.e., file names) of only tuples <file name, contents> local to that cluster member; counts the occurrence of the keyword of each file; and returns a string that includes “filename1 count1 filename2 count2...".

Documentation:

**InvertedIndexingLocal.java** The class performs inverted indexing on a local Hazelcast map. It takes a keyword as input and retrieves files from the map. It counts the occurrences of the keyword in each file and stores the results in a local hashtable. The class utilizes Hazelcast, a distributed computing platform, to access the map and perform the indexing operation. The elapsed time for the indexing process is measured using timers. After the indexing is complete, the class displays the file names along with the respective occurrence counts of the keyword. This class enables efficient local indexing of files based on a given keyword using the Hazelcast framework.

**InvertedIndexingRemote.java** The class enables distributed inverted indexing on a cluster using Hazelcast. It accepts a keyword as a command-line argument and performs inverted indexing on the cluster members. It starts a Hazelcast instance, submits a callable object to each member, and collects the results asynchronously. The class utilizes a callback to process the results received from the cluster members. It populates a local map with the inverted index data and prints the file names along with their corresponding counts. The class provides a convenient way to perform distributed inverted indexing, allowing efficient searching and retrieval of information across the cluster.

**InvertedIndexingEach.java**
The class performs inverted indexing on a specified keyword. It implements the Callable interface to support concurrent execution and the HazelcastInstanceAware interface to receive the Hazelcast instance. The class represents a task that operates on a distributed Hazelcast map containing files. It retrieves the local entries from the map, splits the values into words, and counts the occurrences of the keyword. It stores the results in a local hashtable. The class provides a method to execute the indexing task and returns a string representation of the inverted index result.

**Additional feature - Agent-Based Inverted Indexing**
The additional feature implemented in this project is the utilization of mobile agents for inverted indexing and performance comparison with the existing InvertedIndexingRemote approach. The agent-based inverted indexing functionality is achieved by modifying the Place.java class from HW3 to start a Hazelcast instance and load files into a Hashtable for agent access. The Inject.java class is also modified to accept the keyword via the command line to be passed to the agent. A new TestAgent.java class is created, which hops to specified destinations, performs inverted indexing on local files using the place object, and saves the results to a local Hashtable. Finally, the agent returns to the original host to print the inverted indexing results. This approach allows for a comparative evaluation of execution performance between mobile agents and the InvertedIndexingRemote approach.
